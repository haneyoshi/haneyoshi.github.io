                <p>
                    <strong>MediCheck</strong> is a clinic service management system designed to revolutionize the diagnostic and documentation process for medical professionals. By replacing traditional manual methods with an intuitive interface, MediCheck streamlines workflows, enhances decision-making, and improves clinical efficiency. This tool empowers medical professionals to focus on patient care while the system handles the complexities of data management.

                    <h2>Key Features:</h2>
                        <p>
                            MediCheck offers three core functionalities that improve clinical workflows:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Real-Time Symptom Suggestions:</strong> Dynamically suggests co-occurring symptoms based on user input, helping build a comprehensive diagnostic picture.</li>
                            <li><strong>Disease Prediction:</strong> Analyzes symptoms to identify the most probable diseases, providing data-driven insights.</li>
                            <li><strong>Medicine Recommendation:</strong> Suggests relevant medicines by analyzing symptoms and predicted diagnoses, ensuring targeted and effective treatment.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h2>Motivation and Learning:</h2>
                        <p>
                            The inspiration for MediCheck stems from a desire to solve real-world problems using computer science. While many focus on game or web development, this project explores the intersection of healthcare and technology, creating meaningful impact. Developing MediCheck allowed me to gain hands-on experience in:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Conceptualizing and planning a practical project from idea to implementation.</li>
                            <li>Analyzing real-world use cases to design relevant features.</li>
                            <li>Developing efficient data structures and algorithms to manage complex workflows.</li>
                            <li>Integrating database-driven functionality for dynamic operations.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            This experience strengthened my ability to translate ideas into actionable, impactful solutions.

                    MediCheck is designed to handle common clinic management tasks and provide advanced diagnostic support:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Manage patient workflows, including check-ins, registrations, and detailed record retrieval.</li>
                    <li>Add patients to queues for consultation or remove them after service.</li>
                    <li>Document diagnoses while dynamically suggesting co-occurring symptoms as users input data.</li>
                    <li>Predict possible diseases based on the reported symptoms, offering data-driven insights.</li>
                    <li>Recommend medications tailored to the diagnosis and symptoms, balancing effective treatment and symptom relief.</li>

                <h2>Future Enhancements</h2>
                <p>
                    While the current version of this clinic service management system is functional and fulfills its core objectives, several areas could be improved for a more polished and professional experience:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Commenting Out Debugging Logs:</strong> Remove or refine development logs to streamline the codebase and improve maintainability.</li>
                    <li><strong>Enhanced Output Presentation:</strong> Redesign outputs to ensure clarity, better visualization, and a user-friendly experience.</li>
                    <li><strong>Comprehensive Documentation:</strong> Develop detailed user manuals and technical documentation for easier onboarding and usage.</li>
                    <li><strong>User Interface (UI):</strong> Implement an intuitive and modern UI to enhance usability and make the program accessible to a broader audience.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    These enhancements reflect my ongoing commitment to learning and delivering high-quality software solutions.
